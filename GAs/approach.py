Hybrid Approach

1. Initial Approximation with GA on Reduced Compartment:
   - Use GA to find an initial approximation in the reduced compartment.
   - Once the GA converges to a satisfactory level (e.g., 95% of the target fitness),
     upsample the result to the original size.

2. Intermediate Refinement with GA on Original Compartment:
   - Use GA again on the upsampled result in the original compartment for a 
     limited number of generations.
   - This intermediate step allows the GA to refine the initial condition 
     at the original scale, capturing more spatial details without immediately
     resorting to computationally intensive gradient-based methods.

3. Final Refinement with Gradient-Based Techniques:
   - Use the refined GA result as the starting point for more precise
     optimization algorithms like Adam and gradient descent.
   - Fine-tune the initial condition to achieve higher accuracy.
