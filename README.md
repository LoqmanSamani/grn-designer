# GRN Designer Algorithm

GRN Designer is a computational framework for constructing and optimizing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to generate target spatial patterns. Combining evolutionary and gradient-based optimization techniques, this algorithm enables efficient design of GRNs by tuning parameters for gene interactions and spatial initial conditions. The GRN Designer simulates gene expression patterns in a 2D environment, accounting for both diffusion dynamics and custom initial conditions, providing a flexible tool for synthetic biology and spatial pattern modeling.
Key Features

- ***Dual Optimization:*** Integrates genetic algorithms for global search with Adam optimization for local tuning, ensuring robust and precise GRN configuration.
- ***Custom Initial Conditions:*** Supports spatially varied initial conditions for each gene, enhancing biological realism.
- ***Scalable Complexity:*** Adjustable model complexity to simulate a range of target patterns and GRN architectures.

This tool is ideal for researchers and enthusiasts in synthetic biology, developmental biology, and systems biology.
